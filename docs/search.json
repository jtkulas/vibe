    "text": "To create compelling content for your engagement survey landing page at jtkulas.github.io/vibe/, the goal is to attract potential clients by clearly communicating the value of your survey, building trust, and encouraging participation with a user-friendly and engaging experience. Below, I’ll provide content ideas tailored to your engagement survey landing page, drawing on best practices for survey landing pages to boost response rates and engagement. These suggestions aim to make your page inviting, professional, and action-oriented, while addressing common user concerns and motivations. Since your site is built with Quarto, I’ll also include Quarto-specific formatting tips to implement these ideas effectively.\n\n\nContent Ideas for Your Engagement Survey Landing Page\nBased on the principles outlined in resources like Bitly, Opinion Stage, and SuperSurvey, here are actionable content ideas to enhance your landing page and draw in potential clients:\n\n1. Compelling Headline and Subheadline\nA clear, benefit-driven headline grabs attention and communicates the purpose of your survey. The subheadline provides additional context to motivate participation.\nExample Content:\n\n# Discover What Drives Your Team’s Success {style=\"text-align: center;\"}\n\nTake our quick Vibe Engagement Survey to unlock insights into your workplace culture and boost team performance.\n\n\nWhy It Works: The headline is bold and action-oriented, while the subheadline emphasizes the benefit (insights) and reassures users the survey is quick.\nQuarto Implementation: Use the centered text styling as shown above. Place this in your markdown file (e.g., index.qmd). Ensure the font size is prominent by adjusting CSS in styles.css:\n\n\n  h1 {\n    font-size: 2.5em;\n    font-weight: bold;\n    margin-bottom: 0.5em;\n  }\n\n\n\n\n2. Floating Image with Wrapped Text\nTo make the page visually engaging, include an image (e.g., a happy team or data visualization) floated to the right or left of a persuasive paragraph, as you requested earlier.\nExample Content:\n\n::: {style=\"overflow: auto;\"}\n![Team collaboration](images/team-vibe.jpg){style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; width: 300px;\"}\n\nYour team’s vibe matters. Our engagement survey helps you understand what motivates your employees, identifies areas for improvement, and fosters a thriving workplace. In just 5 minutes, you’ll gain actionable insights to enhance productivity and satisfaction. Join leading organizations who trust Vibe to transform their workplace culture.\n\n:::\n\n\nWhy It Works: The floated image draws attention without overwhelming the text, which highlights the survey’s value (actionable insights, quick completion) and builds credibility (mentioning “leading organizations”).\nQuarto Implementation: Save your image in the images/ folder of your Quarto project. Adjust the width and margin-left in the style attribute to fit your design. The overflow: auto; ensures the div clears the float properly. Add to index.qmd or a dedicated page.\n\n\n\n3. Clear Call-to-Action (CTA)\nA strong, action-oriented CTA encourages users to take the survey immediately. Place it prominently and repeat it strategically.\nExample Content:\n\n::: {.centered style=\"text-align: center; margin: 2em 0;\"}\n[Take the Vibe Survey Now](survey.qmd){style=\"background-color: #007BFF; color: white; padding: 0.8em 1.5em; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 5px;\"}\n:::\n\n\nWhy It Works: The CTA is direct, creates urgency (“Now”), and uses inviting language. The button styling ensures it stands out.\nQuarto Implementation: Add this to your markdown file. Customize the button’s colors in styles.css for brand consistency:\n\n\n  .centered a {\n    background-color: #007BFF;\n    color: white;\n    padding: 0.8em 1.5em;\n    text-decoration: none;\n    border-radius: 5px;\n    display: inline-block;\n  }\n  .centered a:hover {\n    background-color: #0056b3;\n  }\n\n\n\n\n4. Benefits Section with Bullet Points\nHighlight the specific benefits of taking your survey to convince potential clients of its value.\nExample Content:\n\n## Why Take the Vibe Engagement Survey?\n\n- **Uncover Hidden Insights**: Identify what drives employee engagement and where challenges lie.\n- **Quick and Easy**: Complete the survey in under 5 minutes, designed for busy professionals.\n- **Actionable Results**: Receive a tailored report with clear steps to improve workplace culture.\n- **Trusted by Leaders**: Join companies like [Client Name] who transformed their teams with Vibe.\n\n\nWhy It Works: Bullet points are scannable and cater to users who skim content. They emphasize key benefits like speed, actionable outcomes, and credibility.\nQuarto Implementation: Add this section to your markdown file. Enhance readability with CSS:\n\n\n  ul {\n    list-style-type: disc;\n    margin-left: 2em;\n    line-height: 1.6;\n  }\n\n\n\n\n5. Social Proof (Testimonials or Trust Signals)\nIncluding testimonials or trust signals builds credibility and reassures potential clients.\nExample Content:\n\n::: {style=\"text-align: center; margin: 2em 0;\"}\n&gt; “The Vibe Survey gave us clear insights into our team’s morale and helped us boost retention by 20%.”  \n&gt; — Jane Doe, HR Director, [Company Name]\n\n&gt; “Easy to use and incredibly impactful. Vibe transformed how we approach employee engagement.”  \n&gt; — John Smith, CEO, [Company Name]\n:::\n\n\nWhy It Works: Testimonials provide social proof, showing real-world success and building trust.\nQuarto Implementation: Use blockquote syntax (&gt;) for testimonials. Style them in styles.css:\n\n\n  blockquote {\n    font-style: italic;\n    color: #555;\n    border-left: 4px solid #007BFF;\n    padding-left: 1em;\n    margin: 1em 0;\n  }\n\n\n\n\n6. Interactive or Visual Element\nAdd a small interactive element, like a preview question or infographic, to increase engagement.\nExample Content:\n\n## Try a Sample Question\n\nHow often do your employees feel recognized for their contributions?  \n- [ ] Always  \n- [ ] Often  \n- [ ] Sometimes  \n- [ ] Rarely  \n- [ ] Never  \n\n[See How Vibe Works](about.qmd){style=\"color: #007BFF; text-decoration: underline;\"}\n\n\nWhy It Works: A sample question gives users a taste of the survey, making it less intimidating and more engaging.\nQuarto Implementation: Use markdown for the list and link. For a more interactive experience, consider embedding a simple survey form using a tool like Google Forms or Typeform, integrated via iframe:\n\n\n  &lt;iframe src=\"https://forms.gle/your-form-link\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400px\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\nAdd to _quarto.yml to ensure iframe compatibility:\n\n  format:\n    html:\n      embed-resources: true\n\n\n\n7. Footer Content for Credibility\nAdd a centered footer to reinforce trust and provide navigation, as you asked about earlier.\nExample Content:\n\n---\nwebsite:\n  page-footer:\n    center: |\n      Vibe Surveys | Trusted by 100+ Organizations | [Contact Us](contact.qmd) | [Privacy Policy](privacy.qmd)\n---\n\n\nWhy It Works: A footer reinforces your brand, provides trust signals, and offers navigation for users who want more information.\nQuarto Implementation: Add this to your _quarto.yml file. Style the footer in styles.css:\n\n\n  footer {\n    text-align: center;\n    padding: 1em;\n    background-color: #f8f8f8;\n    font-size: 0.9em;\n  }\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Tips for Your Landing Page\n\nKeep It Simple: Limit survey questions to 5–10 and ensure they’re relevant to your goal (e.g., workplace engagement). Avoid overwhelming users with too many fields.\nMobile Optimization: Ensure your Quarto site is responsive. Use Quarto’s default themes or customize styles.css for mobile-friendly design:\n\n\n  @media (max-width: 600px) {\n    img {\n      float: none !important;\n      margin: 0 auto 1em;\n      width: 100%;\n    }\n  }\n\n\n\nTrack Engagement: Use analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics) to monitor page views, bounce rates, and survey completions. Add tracking code to _quarto.yml:\n\n\n  format:\n    html:\n      include-in-header:\n        text: |\n          &lt;script async src=\"https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=YOUR-GA-ID\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n          &lt;script&gt;\n            window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];\n            function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}\n            gtag('js', new Date());\n            gtag('config', 'YOUR-GA-ID');\n          &lt;/script&gt;\n\n\nA/B Testing: Test variations of your headline, CTA, or image placement to optimize conversions. Tools like Google Optimize can help.\nColor Psychology: Use a clean, neutral color scheme (e.g., white, grey, blue) to inspire trust and avoid bias. Align with your brand colors in styles.css.\n\n\n\n\nExample Full Page Structure in Quarto\nHere’s how your index.qmd might look with these elements combined:\n\n---\ntitle: \"Vibe Engagement Survey\"\nformat:\n  html:\n    css: styles.css\nwebsite:\n  page-footer:\n    center: |\n      Vibe Surveys | Trusted by 100+ Organizations | [Contact Us](contact.qmd) | [Privacy Policy](privacy.qmd)\n---\n\n# Discover What Drives Your Team’s Success {style=\"text-align: center;\"}\n\nTake our quick Vibe Engagement Survey to unlock insights into your workplace culture and boost team performance.\n\n::: {style=\"overflow: auto;\"}\n![Team collaboration](images/team-vibe.jpg){style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; width: 300px;\"}\n\nYour team’s vibe matters.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Privacy Policy for VIBE Survey\nEffective Date: July 4, 2025\nVIBE, a product division of eRg, is committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of individuals participating in our surveys. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, store, and protect your survey responses, as well as our commitment to transparency through open-source practices.\n\n\n1 Purpose of the Survey\nThe survey is designed to gather feedback regarding employee attitudes, actions, and thoughts about work, including normative comparisons. Action taken in response to aggregated survey results is intended to improve organizational processes and enhance the employee experience.\n\n\n2 Confidentiality of Respondents\n\nAnonymity and Confidentiality: All responses are treated with the highest level of confidentiality. No personally identifiable information (e.g., name, email, or other direct identifiers) are collected unless explicitly stated and consented to during the survey process.\nNo Individual Identification: Survey results are not reported in a way that could identify individual respondents. Data is only be presented in aggregate form, and we do not analyze or report data for groups smaller than five (5) individuals to prevent identification.\nVoluntary Participation: Participation is entirely voluntary. Any respondent may choose not to respond to any or all questions without any consequences.\n\n\n\n3 Data Collection and Use\n\nData Collected: The survey collects responses to questions related to employee engagement. Demographic data, including department, division, workgroup, etc, is used solely to analyze trends in aggregate and is not linked to individual responses.\nPurpose of Data Use: Individual responses are used to construct aggregate estimates of engagement. Data is not used for any purpose beyond what is stated without additional consent.\nData Storage and Security: Survey data is stored securely using databases accessible only to authorized personnel. Access to raw data is restricted to a limited team responsible for analysis, who are bound by ethical principles of their discipline (e.g., APA Standards 4.01–4.07) as well as explicit confidentiality agreements.\n\n\n\n4 Data Aggregation and Reporting\n\nMinimum Group Size: To protect respondent anonymity, data will not be aggregated or reported for any group smaller than five (5) individuals.
