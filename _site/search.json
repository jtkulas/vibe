Red can highlight calls-to-action (buttons, contact info, etc.) and reinforce branding. Avoid academic blues or muted tones—go for confident, energetic contrasts.\nTypography Use modern, sans-serif fonts for headings (e.g., Montserrat, Roboto, Open Sans). Use a readable body font (e.g., Lato, Arial). Headings should be bold and clear.\nLayout Hero section: Prominent logo, punchy headline, visible CTA (e.g., “Request a Demo”). Short, value-focused sections: What is VIBE? What makes it different? Benefits for organizations. Include testimonials, client logos, or “trusted by” section. Simple navigation: Home, Why VIBE, How It Works, Pricing, Contact.\nImagery Use your logo in the header. Add workplace imagery (stock photos of teams, collaboration, happy employees). Use icons for features (Vigor, Immersion, Belongingness, Engagement).\nCalls to Action Buttons: “Request Demo,” “Contact Sales,” “Download Sample Report” Emphasize conversion paths.\nFooter Legal info, privacy policy, social links, contact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n What Makes VIBE Different? - Proprietary metrics - Intuitive dashboards - Proven impact\n\n\n\nDrive Engagement. Inspire Performance.\nRequest Demo"
