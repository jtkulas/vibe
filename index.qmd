# STYLE IDEAS for a Corporate Sales Website
1. Color Palette
Use a clean, professional palette: Black, white, gray, and accent with VIBE’s red.
Red can highlight calls-to-action (buttons, contact info, etc.) and reinforce branding.
Avoid academic blues or muted tones—go for confident, energetic contrasts.
2. Typography
Use modern, sans-serif fonts for headings (e.g., Montserrat, Roboto, Open Sans).
Use a readable body font (e.g., Lato, Arial).
Headings should be bold and clear.
3. Layout
Hero section: Prominent logo, punchy headline, visible CTA (e.g., "Request a Demo").
Short, value-focused sections: What is VIBE? What makes it different? Benefits for organizations.
Include testimonials, client logos, or “trusted by” section.
Simple navigation: Home, Why VIBE, How It Works, Pricing, Contact.
4. Imagery
Use your logo in the header.
Add workplace imagery (stock photos of teams, collaboration, happy employees).
Use icons for features (Vigor, Immersion, Belongingness, Engagement).
5. Calls to Action
Buttons: "Request Demo," "Contact Sales," "Download Sample Report"
Emphasize conversion paths.
6. Footer
Legal info, privacy policy, social links, contact.
