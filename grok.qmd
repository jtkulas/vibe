To create compelling content for your engagement survey landing page at [jtkulas.github.io/vibe/](https://jtkulas.github.io/vibe/), the goal is to attract potential clients by clearly communicating the value of your survey, building trust, and encouraging participation with a user-friendly and engaging experience. Below, I’ll provide content ideas tailored to your engagement survey landing page, drawing on best practices for survey landing pages to boost response rates and engagement. These suggestions aim to make your page inviting, professional, and action-oriented, while addressing common user concerns and motivations. Since your site is built with Quarto, I’ll also include Quarto-specific formatting tips to implement these ideas effectively.

### Content Ideas for Your Engagement Survey Landing Page

Based on the principles outlined in resources like Bitly, Opinion Stage, and SuperSurvey, here are actionable content ideas to enhance your landing page and draw in potential clients:

#### 1. Compelling Headline and Subheadline
A clear, benefit-driven headline grabs attention and communicates the purpose of your survey. The subheadline provides additional context to motivate participation.

**Example Content:**
```{markdown}
# Discover What Drives Your Team’s Success {style="text-align: center;"}

Take our quick Vibe Engagement Survey to unlock insights into your workplace culture and boost team performance.
```

- **Why It Works**: The headline is bold and action-oriented, while the subheadline emphasizes the benefit (insights) and reassures users the survey is quick.
- **Quarto Implementation**: Use the centered text styling as shown above. Place this in your markdown file (e.g., `index.qmd`). Ensure the font size is prominent by adjusting CSS in `styles.css`:
```{css}
  h1 {
    font-size: 2.5em;
    font-weight: bold;
    margin-bottom: 0.5em;
  }
```

#### 2. Floating Image with Wrapped Text
To make the page visually engaging, include an image (e.g., a happy team or data visualization) floated to the right or left of a persuasive paragraph, as you requested earlier.

**Example Content:**
```{markdown}
::: {style="overflow: auto;"}
![Team collaboration](images/team-vibe.jpg){style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; width: 300px;"}

Your team’s vibe matters. Our engagement survey helps you understand what motivates your employees, identifies areas for improvement, and fosters a thriving workplace. In just 5 minutes, you’ll gain actionable insights to enhance productivity and satisfaction. Join leading organizations who trust Vibe to transform their workplace culture.

:::
```

- **Why It Works**: The floated image draws attention without overwhelming the text, which highlights the survey’s value (actionable insights, quick completion) and builds credibility (mentioning “leading organizations”).[](https://bitly.com/blog/landing-pages-for-surveys-and-polls/)
- **Quarto Implementation**: Save your image in the `images/` folder of your Quarto project. Adjust the `width` and `margin-left` in the style attribute to fit your design. The `overflow: auto;` ensures the div clears the float properly. Add to `index.qmd` or a dedicated page.

#### 3. Clear Call-to-Action (CTA)
A strong, action-oriented CTA encourages users to take the survey immediately. Place it prominently and repeat it strategically.

**Example Content:**
```{markdown}
::: {.centered style="text-align: center; margin: 2em 0;"}
[Take the Vibe Survey Now](survey.qmd){style="background-color: #007BFF; color: white; padding: 0.8em 1.5em; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 5px;"}
:::
```

- **Why It Works**: The CTA is direct, creates urgency (“Now”), and uses inviting language. The button styling ensures it stands out.[](https://bitly.com/blog/landing-pages-for-surveys-and-polls/)[](https://forms.app/en/blog/how-to-use-landing-page-surveys-to-increase-conversions)
- **Quarto Implementation**: Add this to your markdown file. Customize the button’s colors in `styles.css` for brand consistency:
```{css}
  .centered a {
    background-color: #007BFF;
    color: white;
    padding: 0.8em 1.5em;
    text-decoration: none;
    border-radius: 5px;
    display: inline-block;
  }
  .centered a:hover {
    background-color: #0056b3;
  }
```

#### 4. Benefits Section with Bullet Points
Highlight the specific benefits of taking your survey to convince potential clients of its value.

**Example Content:**
```{markdown}
## Why Take the Vibe Engagement Survey?

- **Uncover Hidden Insights**: Identify what drives employee engagement and where challenges lie.
- **Quick and Easy**: Complete the survey in under 5 minutes, designed for busy professionals.
- **Actionable Results**: Receive a tailored report with clear steps to improve workplace culture.
- **Trusted by Leaders**: Join companies like [Client Name] who transformed their teams with Vibe.

```

- **Why It Works**: Bullet points are scannable and cater to users who skim content. They emphasize key benefits like speed, actionable outcomes, and credibility.[](https://www.leadpages.com/blog/kinds-of-landing-page-content)
- **Quarto Implementation**: Add this section to your markdown file. Enhance readability with CSS:
```{css}
  ul {
    list-style-type: disc;
    margin-left: 2em;
    line-height: 1.6;
  }
```

#### 5. Social Proof (Testimonials or Trust Signals)
Including testimonials or trust signals builds credibility and reassures potential clients.

**Example Content:**
```{markdown}
::: {style="text-align: center; margin: 2em 0;"}
> “The Vibe Survey gave us clear insights into our team’s morale and helped us boost retention by 20%.”  
> — Jane Doe, HR Director, [Company Name]

> “Easy to use and incredibly impactful. Vibe transformed how we approach employee engagement.”  
> — John Smith, CEO, [Company Name]
:::
```

- **Why It Works**: Testimonials provide social proof, showing real-world success and building trust.[](https://www.leadpages.com/blog/kinds-of-landing-page-content)[](https://www.supersurvey.com/LPE-website-landing-page)
- **Quarto Implementation**: Use blockquote syntax (`>`) for testimonials. Style them in `styles.css`:
```{css}
  blockquote {
    font-style: italic;
    color: #555;
    border-left: 4px solid #007BFF;
    padding-left: 1em;
    margin: 1em 0;
  }
```

#### 6. Interactive or Visual Element
Add a small interactive element, like a preview question or infographic, to increase engagement.

**Example Content:**
```{markdown}
## Try a Sample Question

How often do your employees feel recognized for their contributions?  
- [ ] Always  
- [ ] Often  
- [ ] Sometimes  
- [ ] Rarely  
- [ ] Never  

[See How Vibe Works](about.qmd){style="color: #007BFF; text-decoration: underline;"}
```

- **Why It Works**: A sample question gives users a taste of the survey, making it less intimidating and more engaging.[](https://www.opinionstage.com/survey/landing-page-survey/)[](https://www.leadpages.com/blog/kinds-of-landing-page-content)
- **Quarto Implementation**: Use markdown for the list and link. For a more interactive experience, consider embedding a simple survey form using a tool like Google Forms or Typeform, integrated via iframe:
```{markdown}
  <iframe src="https://forms.gle/your-form-link" width="100%" height="400px"></iframe>
```
  Add to `_quarto.yml` to ensure iframe compatibility:
```{yaml}
  format:
    html:
      embed-resources: true
```

#### 7. Footer Content for Credibility
Add a centered footer to reinforce trust and provide navigation, as you asked about earlier.

**Example Content:**
```{markdown}
---
website:
  page-footer:
    center: |
      Vibe Surveys | Trusted by 100+ Organizations | [Contact Us](contact.qmd) | [Privacy Policy](privacy.qmd)
---
```

- **Why It Works**: A footer reinforces your brand, provides trust signals, and offers navigation for users who want more information.[](https://bitly.com/blog/landing-pages-for-surveys-and-polls/)
- **Quarto Implementation**: Add this to your `_quarto.yml` file. Style the footer in `styles.css`:
```{css}
  footer {
    text-align: center;
    padding: 1em;
    background-color: #f8f8f8;
    font-size: 0.9em;
  }
```

### Additional Tips for Your Landing Page
- **Keep It Simple**: Limit survey questions to 5–10 and ensure they’re relevant to your goal (e.g., workplace engagement). Avoid overwhelming users with too many fields.[](https://www.opinionstage.com/survey/landing-page-survey/)[](https://forms.app/en/blog/how-to-use-landing-page-surveys-to-increase-conversions)
- **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure your Quarto site is responsive. Use Quarto’s default themes or customize `styles.css` for mobile-friendly design:
```{css}
  @media (max-width: 600px) {
    img {
      float: none !important;
      margin: 0 auto 1em;
      width: 100%;
    }
  }
```
- **Track Engagement**: Use analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics) to monitor page views, bounce rates, and survey completions. Add tracking code to `_quarto.yml`:
```{yaml}
  format:
    html:
      include-in-header:
        text: |
          <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=YOUR-GA-ID"></script>
          <script>
            window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
            function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
            gtag('js', new Date());
            gtag('config', 'YOUR-GA-ID');
          </script>
```
- **A/B Testing**: Test variations of your headline, CTA, or image placement to optimize conversions. Tools like Google Optimize can help.[](https://bitly.com/blog/landing-pages-for-surveys-and-polls/)[](https://www.supersurvey.com/LPE-website-landing-page)
- **Color Psychology**: Use a clean, neutral color scheme (e.g., white, grey, blue) to inspire trust and avoid bias. Align with your brand colors in `styles.css`.[](https://www.opinionstage.com/survey/landing-page-survey/)
